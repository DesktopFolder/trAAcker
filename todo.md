# Current Design Notes (Redesign / Refactor / Foundation Development)

Primary todolist:
- Background for main advancements in overlay
- Basic layout in main window
- Get only advancement file from advancements folder for instance

- "Advancement Status" rich object fed into display adaptors
- What is an advancement?
    - Key: category/shortname (FQN)
    - Basic data: Icon (texture ptr?) / Short Name (str) / Category (str)
    - Criterion data: Missing / Completed? Icons optional?

# Core / Refactor ToDo

- ResourceManager refactor!
    - Store textures at different resolutions, with a standardized search/lookup method.
    - Normalize all the different texture loading solutions.

# Initial Todo List (mostly old... I guess)

1. Basic animation on turntables
    - Render background sprites
2. AdvancementsFileProvider <- file stuff only done here
3. AdvancementsProvider
